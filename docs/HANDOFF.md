### Phase 00 - Finish current work - 2026-10-16
- Changed: nothing in the game. Added the fresh-base brief (CLAUDE.md, docs/). Tagged `Baseline` (capital B, as published on GitHub) on commit 718320c: alpha 0.5 (d6b8441) plus the brief.
- Baseline contains: alpha 0.5. Since alpha 0.4.1: new look (glass panels, portrait in the top bar), Bag tab, battle restyle, wide side panel, Graphics gallery, friends, postcard and walking fixes, the tap tracer (?tapdebug=1), quieter sign-in failure.
- Repo vs project: the repo holds game/, studio/, README.md and ART-NOTES.md only. tools/ (115 files, incl. check-quick.py), retired/, the Start-Game/Start-Studio scripts, start-game.py, start-studio.py, STYLE-GUIDE.md and validation/ live only in the owner's project zip. game/, studio/ and README.md in the zip are identical to the repo. Where they should live is a phase 01 decision.
- Verified: `python3 tools/check-quick.py` on the owner's alpha 0.5 project zip, against the owner's validation/quick-baseline (110 pictures). Headless Chromium 141, software WebGL, Playwright 1.56. 2355 s (39 min), 47 steps: 41 passed, 6 failed.
  - Stale test: v31 settings tabs. The test clicks game, look, sound, controls, save, help; 0.5 has sound, graphics, game, save, help. The place card and map camera checks after it did not run.
  - Stale test, or delete the model: v46 "kinds without a room: station". The building list still names `station`; alpha 0.4 replaced train stations with airship masts and no scene places one.
  - Stale test, probably: alpha 0.4 postcards. 0.5 added pcFree() (no postcard until the opening, story, unmet rival and trainer intros are done, plus 3 s of calm walking); the test drops the player in Marigold Town without meeting Blake. Confirm which gate held it.
  - Legacy, delete in phase 03: v39/v40 "v36 save migration" returns an empty save.
  - Not diagnosed: v32 "Wear and tear at 0 still leaves wear" (world.wear = 0 no longer zeroes building wear).
  - Not diagnosed: v42 "wild growth: gallery: not grown" (most likely the 0.5 Graphics gallery scene is outdoor but not wild-grown; exclude it or grow it).
  - Pictures: 50 of 110 differ from the baseline. Spot checks (phone-team, env-day, battle-3d) show the baseline predates the 0.5 new look, so the differences are expected. The owner's last recorded run (2026-10-15) was a 2-step partial run.
  - Slowest steps: Scenes 606 s, v33 226 s, v44 180 s, Phone 135 s, Time/weather/rooms 92 s, v38 92 s, v32 91 s, v47 81 s, Things to do 76 s, v34 74 s.
  - Separately, game and Studio load headless to their title screens. Only error: ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED (the test machine's network).
- Unfinished list (parked, not dropped):
  1. The six failures above (four stale tests or legacy, two to diagnose).
  2. Regenerate validation/quick-baseline from alpha 0.5 so picture comparisons mean something again.
  3. Walking camera: the owner's walk-crossing-test.log shows Hedgerow Lane -> Sundown crossed but "the view followed: False" (held for w:sundown*). Reproduce.
- Decisions I made (and why): kept the check's WebGL run rather than Lite mode, because the baseline and the phone both use WebGL; Lite mode is proposed for the phase 01 `--smoke` set. Did not commit tools/ or validation/ (about 50 MB with pictures) because repo layout and Git LFS are the owner's call in phase 01.
- Owner decided: regenerate the picture baseline at phase 03, not now. Still open: how tools/ and validation/ should live in the repo (phase 01).
- Next session starts with: phase 01. Fix the stale tests first so the check is green, then --smoke (Lite mode for the flows), CI, .gitignore, duplicate functions.
